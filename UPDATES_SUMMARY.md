## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. Plugin Loading
1. Millennium loads the plugin
2. Backend initializes and creates reviews directory
3. CSS and JavaScript files are loaded into Steam UI
4. Plugin is ready for use

### 2. Context Menu Usage
1. User right-clicks on a game
2. JavaScript detects the game ID and name
3. Menu items are dynamically added
4. User clicks "Write Review" or "View Review"
5. Modal opens with appropriate content

### 3. Review Management
1. User writes/edits review in modal
2. JavaScript calls backend API via Millennium IPC
3. Backend saves review to local file
4. User sees success notification

## 📋 Backend API Methods

All methods now have comprehensive logging:

```python
Backend.save_review(game_id, game_name, review_text)    # Save/update review
Backend.load_review(game_id)                           # Load existing review
Backend.delete_review(game_id)                         # Delete review
Backend.has_review(game_id)                           # Check if review exists
Backend.get_all_reviews()                             # Get all reviews
Backend.get_config()                                  # Get plugin configuration
```

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

3. **Game pages** have review button
4. **Modal dialog** opens for writing/editing reviews
5. **Reviews are saved** to local files in reviews/ directory
6. **Notifications** show success/error messages
